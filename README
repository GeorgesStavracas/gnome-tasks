===========
What is Virtaus
===========

Virtaus is an easy-to-use, intuitive and completely free and open source
creativity manager, build upon the GObject technology. It was designed
to be an extremely user-friendly tool.

===============
Unlimited possibilities
===============

Virtaus was conceived with high modularity and extensbility in mind, and
so it offers a powerful extension API. With this, any developer or institution
will be able to easily adapt the application to it's needs without even touching
the source code. Need any image filter? Want another functionality? Make it!

===============
System Requirements
===============

Virtaus should build on most *NIX. It's dependencies are:

* GLib >= 2.36
* Gtk+ >= 3.12
* Sqlite3
